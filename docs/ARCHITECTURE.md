The root is a small Vite + TypeScript landing page with no framework, persistence, authentication, model pipeline, or runtime API dependency. Its anchors work without JavaScript; `src/main.ts` only supplies the current year and reduced-motion-aware reveal behavior.

Each project repository builds and deploys its own `dist/` artifact through GitHub Actions. The user-site repository is the only repository with `CNAME`; GitHub Pages inherits that custom domain for project-site paths.

## Landing deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` runs on pushes to `main` and manual dispatches:

1. Install the locked Node dependencies.
2. Type-check and build the landing.
3. Copy `CNAME` and `.nojekyll` into `dist/` through the package `postbuild` step.
4. Validate compiled CSS/JavaScript, metadata, project paths, and the absence of bundled project directories.
5. Upload and deploy the artifact through GitHub Pages.

## Repository split

The previous composite site stored apps on branches and assembled every build in one workflow. The V1 split gave each app a clean `main` branch and an independent Pages boundary while retaining the original branches and rollback tag in this repository.

PickLedger's models, schedules, grading, committed data, and viewer now live together in `Harsh4873/pickledger`. Research keeps its frontend and backend together in `Harsh4873/research`; its Pages workflow builds only the frontend, while its backend remains a separate hosting boundary.

## Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run upcheck
python3 -m pytest tests/smoke/test_landing.py -q
```

Validation is source-, build-, workflow-, and API-based. Browser and deployed-output inspection is left to the repository owner.
